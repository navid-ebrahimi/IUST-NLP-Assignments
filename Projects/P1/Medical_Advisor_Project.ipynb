        "## What is RAG? 🤔\n",
        "We've all used ChatGPT and experienced moments when it starts to generate content that is often incorrect or unrelated to our query. Do you know why this happens? These Large Language Models (LLMs) are not magical entities; they are simply models trained on a vast amount of text. 📚 You could even consider a significant portion of the internet. However, this is not all the data available in the world, because data is not a static concept. You yourself generate some data every day through your use of the Internet, Social Media, and so on. 🌐💻📱\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no matter how much data you use to train your LLM, you always end up encountering new data. This is one of the reasons behind the famous ChatGPT response that tells you it only knows things up to a certain date. 📅 Also, these models tend to hallucinate too. It means they provide incorrect answers but in a very convincing manner. 🎭\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we have retrieval techniques. Don't worry if it sounds complicated (it actually isn't easy, you may need to take a course to familiarize yourself with these concepts 😅, but that's not necessary for this project), but you use it on a daily basis. You can think of Search Engines (like Google, for example) as a complex form of information retrieval. 🔍\n",
        "\n",
        "So, one day, people came up with this idea that it would be cool if ChatGPT could search Google for us, read the articles for us, summarize what it read, and tell us that. 📖 So, this is not exactly what RAG is, but it's something similar. We have a corpus (a large amount of data) and a query (what a user typed as input). Now, we search through this corpus using techniques related to vectors and vector databases, and find the most similar items in our corpus to the query. Then, we pass these items to an LLM and ask for a structured, well-formatted, user-friendly output. 📈📊"

Initially, I wanted to use this article as the basis for this project, but unfortunately, the llama_index library used in the article seems to be outdated, so most of the code would need to be rewritten. On second thought, I found it more useful to focus on core concepts rather than learning specific libraries. You might want to check out some libraries like langchain or llama_index which provide a lot of tools for RAG. (But not for this project) 📝💡\n",
        "- Don't hesitate to use Google, ask chatbots about any new concepts and terms. If you use search engine-aware chatbots like Microsoft Copilot, they provide links for each part of their answers which is useful if you want to delve deeper into that part. 🌐🤖\n",

        "To create your retriever, you need to use an encoder model. Something like BERT? Nah, BERT is so yesterday. Find something new and shiny! ✨ The basic idea is to encode every document (sentence) in your corpus into a vector space using the same encoder. Then, encode the user query into that same space. With some similarity metrics like dot product, you can find the most similar document to the user’s input and retrieve it. 🎯 You can train your own encoder if you have enough data and resources, 💪 or you can use one of those [ready-made on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending), like these ones."

However, most scientific evidence is at odds with that impression. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Cancer Institute, determined in 1998 that \"cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the oral cavity (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), esophagus, larynx, and lung.\"  The study concerned those who smoked at least one cigar per day, and stated \"The health risks associated with less than daily smoking (occasional smokers) are not known.\" Although the study reports that most cigar smokers do not inhale, some smokers do inhale, particularly former cigarette smokers who have switched to cigars.  This yields risks of lung cancer similar to cigarette smokers. As for Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS, or \" Second-hand Smoking \"), the study points to the large amount of smoke generated by one cigar, saying \"cigars can contribute substantial amounts of tobacco smoke to the indoor environment; and, when large numbers of cigar smokers congregate together in a cigar smoking event, the amount of ETS produced is sufficient to be a health concern for those regularly required to work in those environments.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "4. Before going to bed, make sure your bed is comfortable and clean. If you feel uncomfortable, try adjusting your mattress, pillows, blankets, etc. As a rule of thumb, your room should not have more than two feet of empty floor space between your ceiling and your floor. You should also check your airflow and insulation. The air in your home should be clean, fresh, free of mildew and humidity. People who have asthma may find it challenging to breathe after sleeping in the dark or after having too much exposure to pollen. In this case, it may be best to turn on a fan or air conditioner. Make sure to clean your bedroom after bedtime to eliminate odors and bacteria. Your skin also needs protection from the sun. Choose shoes that provide ample coverage and protect your sensitive skin. Consider wearing a sunhat. Many people also use sunscreen before going out to help prevent the Sunburn and other skin problems. Be sure you wear sun cream and sun blockers after sun exposure. Always report any minor skin irritations to your doctor. Sunscreen can be a bit touchy and irritating. Use it sparingly, on the face and around your eyes only. Some people find that they need sunspots to stay hydrated. Therefore, wear sunglasses to protect the spots. Try to avoid getting direct sunlight on your face for at least 15 minutes every day. After a couple of hours, use a sandbox, table, bench, dresser, chair or other objects to receive some shade from sunbeams or cast shadows. Finally, you can also choose to go home and get your work done while staying indoors during the colder days. Most of the time, we can avoid the direct sun, even if it is going down now, because we have our windows in our rooms. Please remember that even with a window, if a cloud comes on, the sky is dark and can not be seen. Our windows prevent that dark room from being seen by the outside world. We also need some kind of insulator, like a blanket, to keep us warm after a cold winter. Also, people need cool temperature as they may spend many hours in room before sleeping. So, have a bed temperature between 70-80°F, 21-27°C, according to current measurement. Keep cool things like toys and electronics, in a cool place with good insulating material. Let them cool down and turn them off if needed. And if possible, take your device to a room with low humidity and cool air. Lastly, be sure not to sleep on anything but a mat or bed that is under a protective cover. For example, a cover that protects from water or dust. A blanket or sheet is too absorbent and too warm. All the things in my room will cool, so they don't need to cool anymore. Sleeping in too comfortable a place can become a problem. When we go to get some rest, choose a warm and cozy bed. That way, when we come back from sleep, everything will feel much warmer and better. Remember, warmth is the opposite of coldness. To take advantage of this newfound freedom, let's start right now.

Remember to warm up before any physical exercise and stretch after your session. This will help prevent injuries. Your doctor can recommend the right kind of physical therapy for your situation. Many physical therapists offer evidence-based exercise programs and follow a strict protocol to ensure that your exercises have the most positive impact on improving your bloodflow to your muscles. Avoid physical activities that may increase blood stress, which can lead in further escalation of hypertension.

            "Response: - What are the different stages or phases of a cancer that could lead to death?\n",
            "The stages can vary from one tumor type to another, but usually, a person would transition from Stage I to Stage II in five to ten years and from I-II to III within three to five years. Each stage can lead the patient to a more extensive treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, etc. In Stage IV, the tumor has grown too large and often, it has metastasized to parts other then the originally affected organ and the disease cannot be effectively controlled.\n",

            "\n",
            "The difference between stages two and three can be very subtle. A stage two tumor is often the same size as a stage one, while a cell in a stages three tumor can grow to several centimeters or more. As a result, even two stage tumors may be difficult to distinguish, as they often have similar growth rates and sizes. Stage two cancer is more often caused by less aggressive growth, growth that is uncontrolled, when the developing cells do not make new tumors. It is usually characterized by the lack of recurrence of Stage one cancer, though there may still be recurrences. stage three however, is harder to define. There are many different size and growth patterns. When these factors combine, stage 3 tumors are often easier to diagnose and treat.stage three cancer has the potential to become stage four. Once a tumor grows too big, its growth rate can increase drastically, making it more difficult for cells to grow back. This can eventually lead them to metastatize to different locations. Stages four and five are much harder for patients to manage, usually leading to complications and death. However, with aggressive therapies, this can get better. With this in mind, all of these stages and more could cause cancer and eventually a death, so it's essential to have good health habits and to pay attention to signs and symptoms.\n",

            "3. Second-degree headache: Caused by medication over-use or nerve damage in your brainstem, this type of aches can affect the location and severity of previous headaches. A second-grade headache could be more severe than the first. These headche can also be associated more with the pain or discomfort caused by the headache itself rather than any underlying condition. It is the one that is more harmful for the health. Also known as lateral epiphyseal headache or epidermal ischemic encephalopathy. As one of these types, it can lead to symptoms like dizziness, fainting, confusion, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. More severe versions of this condition can involve the central or deep nervous system.  \n",
            "4. Sinous headache (aka vertigo): These can be caused either by overexcitability of white matter or excessive blood pressure, or by nerve stimulation in white blood cells. Their symptoms are often characterized as dizzy and nausea, particularly after prolonged periods of movement. The brain sends a hormone called melatonin to the muscles that move your body in response to these stimuli, causing a temporary decrease in responsiveness to sensory information. Then it gradually recovers and returns to normal. Consequently, headache becomes more intense and vivid. This type is generally not associated directly with a specific underlying health condition, but it may be part of an episode of migrain or cluster head. However, sometimes it is a cause for concern. Some people may feel vertigous after a migraine or Cluster Head. They need to get checked by their doctor. For more information on this, you can refer to “The Causes and Symptoms of Headaches” by Dr. Daniel Shepherd. By this way, head can feel more like what they should be. He can learn, what is happening to him and he can start fixing the issue as soon as possible.\n",

            "Diabetes insípidus is characterized by excessive thirst and excessive urinar\n",
            ". The excessive drinking and urinating is caused by the lack of vasopressin, a hormone that regulates water balance in the body. Vasop ressin is produced by a small area of the brain called the hypothalamus. In diabetes, the vaspressin-producing cells in this area are destroyed. This causes the water to be lost from the blood and is excreted in urine. As a result, you feel thirsty and need to drink more water. You also urinate more often. If you do not drink enough, your blood becomes too concentrated and you can become dehydrated. Dehydration can cause dizziness, headache, fatigue, confusion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or fainting. A person with diabetes may also have a dry mouth, dry skin, blurred vision, slow healing of wounds, frequent infections, irritable bowel syndrome, muscle weakness, poor circulation, low blood pressure, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, high blood sugar, blood in your urine, dark-coloured urine and weight loss. Diabetes insípisus is usually diagnosed by measuring the amount of water in a 12-hour urine sample. Other tests may be done to check for other causes of excessive water loss, such as heart failure, kidney failure or hyperthyroidism. Treatment is with vas pressin or a vas-pressing drug. These drugs are given by injection or by an IV drip. People with DI should also drink plenty of fluids.\n",

            "A blood test is used to measure the amount of blood in your body. Blood tests are used for many reasons, such as to check for anemia, to see if you are pregnant, for cancer screening, as well as for other reasons. There are many different types of tests that can measure your amount and type of red blood cells. The most common test for blood type is called an A, B, AB, O blood group test. This test measures the type and amount red and white blood cell in the sample. Another test that is often used is an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test, which measures how fast your red cells move. A third test called a complete blood count (CBC) measures your total number of white and red cell. These tests can also be used in combination to determine the cause of a problem. For example, a CBC test can show that you do not have enough red or white cells, but an ESR test may show you that your cells are moving too fast. In addition, these tests may be combined with other tests to find out if there is any damage to a particular organ. Finally, blood tests also can determine if a person has a disease. Some diseases can only be diagnosed by a blood sample, while others can require a tissue sample or other type. of test to confirm the diagnosis. However, there are also many diseases that cannot be detected by blood or tissue samples. Therefore, doctors often use blood and tissue tests in conjunction with each other to make a diagnosis of disease or condition. When a doctor uses blood samples to diagnose a condition, they will usually take a small amount from the patient and send it to laboratory for analysis. Once the laboratory has analyzed the samples, the doctor will be able to tell if the person is suffering from a certain disease, condition or disorder. Sometimes, however, this is not enough information to give a clear diagnosis, so the doctors will often take another sample from another part of body to test it as a backup. After the tests have been completed, if they are positive, then the next step is to treat the disease with medication or surgery. Depending on the severity of condition and the effectiveness of treatment, patients may need to undergo surgery or medication for a long time. Although blood testing is very useful in diagnosing diseases, some people may not want to have their blood tested. They may feel that it would be too invasive or that they would not be comfortable with the results. Other people, on other hand, may want their results to show them that there may have a serious problem that needs attention. Whatever the reason, people should be aware of what blood results mean and how they can affect their health and well-being. People should always consult their doctor before having any blood work done. Doctors can explain the meaning of results and what they mean for the individual. Additionally, many doctors can provide information on how to interpret results, what to do if results are abnormal, how often to get blood drawn, when to expect results from tests, who should get results reported to, where to send results for testing, whether results should go to insurance company, doctor, employer, school, work, family, friends, spouse, partner, children, parents, grandparents, siblings, extended family members, neighbors, co-workers, colleagues, classmates, students, teachers, coaches, team members and so on. Many people are unaware of their rights and responsibilities when it comes to blood. Tests can reveal a lot about a patient’s health, including whether they have cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, liver disease and many other conditions. Because of this, tests should only ever be done with a valid reason. Patients should never be forced to submit to tests. Also, results of any test should not ever go public without the consent of patient. Results should remain confidential and only shared with those who need them. Furthermore, test results can never ever replace a visit to doctor or nurse. Only a medical professional can interpret test result and recommend treatment options. No matter what the situation, always remember that blood has the power to save lives. That is why it’ s so important for people to know what their test means and to understand how it can impact their lives and health in general. By being informed, we can make better decisions about our health care and our lives in whole. We can save our own lives as we save the lives of others. And that’ is what it all comes down to in end. Life is precious and we should do everything we possibly can to protect it and keep it safe. I hope this article has been helpful to you. Please share it with your friends and family. Thank you for reading! Blood is one of our most important organs. Without it, our bodies would die. Our blood carries oxygen and nutrients to our cells and carries away waste products. But what is blood made of? Blood consists of three main parts: red, white, platelets. Red blood contains hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries the oxygen from our lungs to all parts of bodies. White blood consists mostly of lymphocytes, cells that help fight infection. Platelets are small cells in blood that form clots to stop bleeding. All three parts work together to maintain health of person. What is normal blood range? Normal blood ranges are as follows: Red Blood Cell Count: Men 0.45-055 million/mm3 Women  ˜040- ½0 million /mm ³ White Blood Count (WBC): Men:03-11 million per cubic millimeter Women:350,0 ²-801,5 per mm3 Platelet Count : Men :  ˆ15, ¼-44,4 million  per milliliter Women :12,6-39,8 million . per ml. How do I know if my blood counts are normal? There is no way to predict what your counts will look like. Each person’ ́s blood will have different counts. To find your normal range, ask your physician. He or she will run tests and give you a report. Why is it important? It’ s important because blood helps us live. Every day, your organs need oxygen to function properly. Oxygen is carried by red. blood to every part. Of your bodies, from your brain to. your feet. With enough oxygen, organs can work properly and you can live a normal life. Too little oxygen can result in organ damage and death of cells or tissues. Is there anything I can do to improve my counts? Yes, lifestyle choices can improve your numbers. Here’re some tips: Eat a well balanced, nutritious diet Exercise Regularly Get enough sleep Avoid smoking and alcohol Limit stress Get regular exercise. Regular exercise can increase your oxygen levels and improve blood circulation. Make sure to include cardiovascular exercise in routine. Cardiovascular exercise is exercise that increases your heartbeat\n",

            "The first step in controlling asthma is to identify and avoid triggers. Triggers are things that make asthma worse. Common triggers include allergens, such as pollen, dust, and pet dander; irritants, including smoke and strong odors; and exercise. If you know what your triggers are, you can take steps to avoid them. For example, if you are allergic to pollen and your asthma gets worse when you’re outside, stay inside on days when the pollen count is high. You can also use an air filter to reduce the amount of pollen in your home. In addition to avoiding triggers, there are other ways to control asthma. Medications can help control inflammation and open the airways. These include inhalers, oral medications, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics. Lifestyle changes can include avoiding irritant triggers and exercising regularly.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. Use a peak flow meter: This device measures how much air you force out of your lungs. It can tell you how well your airways are opening and closing. By measuring your peak expiratory flow rate, or PEFR, on a regular basis, your doctor can track your response to treatment and determine if your condition is improving or worsening. This can lead to better management of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. Take medication as prescribed: Always take your medication exactly as your healthcare provider has prescribed. Do not stop or change your medications without talking to them first. \n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, here are some other tips to help prevent and manage asthma: \n",
            "1) Use an inhaler correctly: Make sure you understand how to use your inhalER correctly. Practice using it often so that you become familiar with the technique. Ask your provider for a demonstration if needed. Make use of a spacer device if one is recommended. A spacer is an extra device that helps you breathe more easily when using an asthma inhal. The spacer helps to slow down the medicine so you get a full dose and it helps prevent the medication from being swallowed instead of being inhaled. \n",
            " \n",
            "2) Avoid irritations: Try to minimize your exposure as best as you possibly can. Irritants can trigger asthma symptoms. Examples include smoke, strong smells, air pollution, pet hair, mold, pollen or dust. Try not to smoke yourself or allow others to do so around you. Keep your house clean and dust-free. Wear a mask if necessary when working with irritating substances. Stay indoors when air quality is poor. \n",
            " \n",
            " 3) Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can improve your overall health and help you manage your symptoms better. Just make sure to warm up before exercising and to cool down afterward. Start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. Talk to a doctor or physical therapist about the best way to incorporate exercise into your routine. \n",

            "Stress can also cause mental problems, such as depression and anxiety. In addition, it can make you more likely to get sick. This is because stress can weaken your immune system.

            "The symptoms may vary from person to person. The symptoms are usually mild and may not be noticed by the person or his/her family. As the symptoms worsen, the patient may become confused, agitated, aggressive, withdrawn, depressed, anxious, irritable, apathetic, uncooperative, hostile, violent, confused and disoriented. These symptoms can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as loss or gain of weight, sleep disturbances, incontinence, inability to speak, lack of coordination and balance. In the later stages, patients may lose the ability to communicate, walk, eat, drink, dress, bathe, use the bathroom, control their body functions, perform daily tasks, make decisions, remember people and places, understand and respond to others, recognize themselves, respond appropriately to their environment, move their limbs, speak and understand language. They may also experience hallucinations, delusions, agitation, anxiety, depression, anger, fear, restlessness, insomnia, hallucinations and delusional behavior. Patients may experience a loss in their ability and desire to engage in activities they once enjoyed. Their ability for self-care may decline and they may need help with their daily activities. This may include help in bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding, toileting, moving around, managing their finances, driving, shopping, cooking, cleaning, taking care of their pets, maintaining their home, attending to personal hygiene, handling their mail, paying bills, keeping track of appointments, remembering to take medications, getting to and from appointments and maintaining relationships.

            "1. What is Alzheimer disease and what are its symptoms? Alzheimer Disease is an incurable, progressive, neurodegenerative disease. Its symptoms begin with memory impairment and confusion. Over time, symptoms become more severe. Symptoms include difficulty performing everyday tasks and problems communicating and understanding. Eventually, memory, language and personality are affected. 100% of people with Alzheimer will eventually lose their memory. People with this disease will lose all their memories and will not remember their loved ones. There is also a risk that the individual will become violent and aggressive. A person with AD will also lose control of his or her body. He or she will be unable to walk or move. AD can cause a person's body to become paralyzed. At the end of life, people will have difficulty breathing and eating. Many people die from pneumonia. Some people may die in a nursing home. Others may live at home with family members. However, they will need a lot of help. Most people who have AD live for about 8 to12 years. But some people live longer. Those who live the longest may have the mildest form. How does AD start? AD starts with a small memory problem. Then, it gets worse over time. Sometimes, AD begins with problems that are not related to memory or thinking. Often, these problems are related with mood and emotions. When AD progresses, individuals may develop problems related in the following areas:  • Communication and speaking • Thinking and reasoning • Memory and remembering • Movement and coordination • Personality and character • Behavior and mood • Vision and sight • Hearing and hearing loss • Sense of smell and taste • Ability to do everyday activities • Social skills and relationships • Self-control and self care • Physical health and well-being • Mental health\n",
            "2. Who is at risk for AD? Anyone can get AD at any age. Usually, however, this condition affects people over the age of 65. About 90 percent of all cases of memory-loss are caused by AD or a related disease called vascular dementia (VD). AD affects men and women equally. Although it is more common in women, men can develop AD as well. Family history is one of many risk factors for developing AD later in life or even in early adulthood. Individuals who are at high risk include those who: • Have a parent or sibling with early-stage AD • Are over 75 years old • Do not have high education or training • Live alone • Were not physically active during their lifetime • Suffer from depression or anxiety • Take certain medications that can increase the risk, such a non-steroid antiinflammatory medications (e.g., ibuprofens) or statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) • Eat a diet high in saturated fat and low in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, eggs, dairy, meat, poultry, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, seafood, wine, beer, spirits, chocolate, coffee, tea, sugar, salt, fat, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, spices, herbs, vitamins, minerals, supplements, food additives, preservatives, colorings, flavorings and other chemicals. • May have certain genetic mutations that increase their risk. One of those mutations is called the APOE ε4. Having this gene increases the chance of developing the condition. Another risk factor is having a history or family or friends who had AD and/or other forms of mental illness. Studies show that people whose parents or siblings have early onset AD are more likely to develop the same disease at a younger age than those whose family has no history. Researchers are still trying to understand why this is. Scientists are also studying the role of genetics in AD development. Currently, scientists are studying how genes may play a role in developing and treating AD in several ways. First, researchers are trying...View Source\n",
            "3. Are there any other symptoms besides memory? Yes. Memory loss is not the only symptom of having AD; there may other signs and symptoms. Here are a few: A change in personality or character. Changes in behavior and moods. Difficulty in doing everyday things. Problems with communication and speech. Loss of vision and sense of taste and smell. Physical problems such has loss weight and muscle mass. Mental problems like depression and anxiety.

            "Response: Answer: Food allergies are a form of immune system disorder. When you eat a certain food that you are allergic to, the immune response can cause a variety of symptoms. Symptoms can include: hive-like rash, itching, swelling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, and anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening condition that can occur in people with allergies to certain foods. It is characterized by a rapid drop in blood pressure and a decrease in oxygen levels. This can lead to death. People with an anaphylactic reaction may also experience a drop of blood sugar, which can result in confusion, weakness, or loss of consciousness. A person with this condition may need to be treated with epipens, an epinearine injection, to prevent anaphalactic reactions.\n",
            "The most common food allergens are: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, nuts, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews, etc.), and shellfish. However, any food can potentially cause an allerg. Food allergy symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may only experience mild symptoms, while others may have severe reactions that require immediate treatment with antihistamines or epenephrine injections. In some cases, food-induced anafilaxis can be fatal. Therefore, it’ s important to know what foods you’re allergic and to always carry an EpiPen with you. You should also carry a list of your food alergies with your EPIpen. Make sure to keep your list up to date. For example: if your allergies change, you should update your allergy list. Also, make sure that your family and friends know about your alerg. They should be able to recognize the symptoms of an alerg and know when to call for help. Lastly, always check the labels on food products before you consume them. Many products contain hidden allergens that may cause you to have an adverse reaction if consumed. By following these simple steps, people can help prevent food allergic reactions and live a healthy life. .\n",
            "Food allergies can develop at any age. Most people develop food sensitivities in childhood, but some develop them later in life as well. There are many different types of food sensit. These include food intolerances, such as lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Allergies are also a common cause of sensiti. Common food allergi. include milk allergy and peanut allergy. Milk allergy can affect people of all ages, although it most commonly affects children. Peanut allergy affects about 1 in 50 children and 2 in every 300 adults. Both milk and nut allergies tend to run in families. That means that if one member of a family has an food sensitivity, other family members may be more likely to develop one as we. As a result, many people who develop a milk or nut allergy have family history of these conditions. While food intolerance is not an immune-mediated condition, like food аллергия, some people do develop intoler. to specific foods as a reaction of their immune systems. Gluten intolerance can also cause food reactions, as can celiaci disease, another immune disorder that affects the small intestine. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the gluten protein in wheat causes damage to small intestinal villi, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. Although celia. is most often diagnosed in children, adults can get it as wel. and it can go undiagnosed for years. celic disease can have many symptoms including bloating, gas, stomach pain and diarrhea. Because celac. can damage the vill. in the intestine, malnutrit. may occur. Malnutr. from celaci. disease may include anemia, fatigue, weight loss and osteoporosis. Celac.. is treated by following a gluten-free diet. With celacia. , the damage done to intestinal vili. by gluten can take years to repair. Even after a person stops eating gluten, symptoms may persist for months or years before the intestinal tissue can heal. To diagnose celcia. or gluten intoleranc. a blood test for antibodies to gluten is used. Another test that is sometimes used is the tissue biopsy, in w. the doctor takes a small sample of intestinal tis. for examination under a microscope. Treatment for celci. involves a strict gluten free diet for life, since gluten cannot be removed from the diet once it has been consumed by the person or animal. Those with celici. should avoid all foods containing gluten. Foods containing wheat gluten include bread, pasta, cakes, cookies, crackers, cereals, beer, wine, whiskey, vodka, vermouth, bouillon, soup, sauce, dressing, condiments, flavoring, seasoning, spice, yeast, baking powder, corn meal, flour, meal and meal mix. Since gluten has many names, those with gluten intoleran. must be careful to read labels and ask about ingredients when eating out. Eating gluten may result i. an inflammatory response in those who are intolerant to it. Inflammation can trigger a number of reactions in celacci. including diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Over time, celaca. damage can make the intestines less efficient at absorbing nutrients, resulting in malnourish. which may lead t. anemia and fatigue. Without treatment, over time the malnurt. caused by celica. could lead i.. to osteoporosis, heart disease and other serious health problems. Treating celai. with the right diet is important for the long-term health of those affected by it, because the disease cannot currently be cured. Following a strictly gluten fre. diet can improve symptoms and help the digestive system heal over tim. But it may take months for symptoms to improve and the healing process to begin. Once the process has begun, however, there is no turning back. No matter how long it takes, once the gut has healed, no gluten will ever be tolerated again. \n",
            "How do you know you're allergic? Answer from a Health Advisor:  Food Allergy Symptoms: . Food alergi can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms include hiving, itchiness, redness, bloatedness, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe symptoms are anafylaxis, also known as anephratic shock. Anaaphyl. shock can involve a sudden drop i blood presur. leading t a loss in consciousness and death if not treated immediately. Any food may trigger an reaction, though some foods are more common triggers than others. Examples of common allergen. are milk products, egg, peanut, shell fish and tree nut. More rare food triggers include soy products and wheat. Your body’ reaction t food is due to an overactive immune s. system. Instead of just ignoring the allergeni. as you would with other food sensibil. your body is actually attacking the protein. that it identifies as harmful. During this attack, histamine is released into the blood stream. Histamine causes the allergic symptoms that we all know and love. One of histamines main functions is t cause the constriction of our blood vessels. Constriction is when the walls of t blood vessel contract, making the vessel smaller. Blood vessels that are constricted can’ t carry as much blood, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the vessels and around the bod. constricting blood v.s. dilating blood ves. means the same thing. Dilating is just a fancy word for expanding. Our blood is made up of red and white blood cells. Red blood cell. carry oxygen to our organs and tissues. White blood c. fight off infections and diseases. We need both red blood and wite blood to live. Not enough of either can mean serious problems for our health. Too much of one can create problems as wll. Having too much red b.d. cell can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. On the other hand, having too many white bld. cells can indicate an infection or disease that needs to b treated. What is histamin? Histamin is one of many chemical messengers in our body. Chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the messengers that carry messages between our cells and organs. Like a letter carrier delivering mail, neurotransm. send messages from one part of body to another. Sometimes, these messages can become confused and send the wrong message. Or, sometimes, they can send too m. messages. Either way, this can disrupt the normal function of organs in body and create health problem. How does histam. cause allergic sympt. ? When histami. gets released, our immune sy. responds by producing more hist. hista. causes our bod to release more red bl.c. than normal. And, more white bl.. cells are produced to fight the inv\n",

            "Query: Can you explain the stages of cancer?\n",
            "Response: Answer: Cancer is a disease that develops in stages. It starts with a single cell that has become abnormal and begins to grow and divide out of control. This abnormal cell forms a tumor. As the tumor grows, it can spread from its original location to nearby tissues and then to distant parts in the human body, which is called metastasis. There are four main stages in cancer: stage 0, stage I, II, III, IV. Stage 1 is the earliest stage of a cancer. At this stage, the abnormal cells are confined to a small area, but they have not spread outside of that area. If the disease is not treated, then the stage increases. In stage II the tumors have spread beyond the area where they started. However, they are still confined within a specific part of your body and have yet to spread into other areas. When the diseases spread further, to different parts or organs of body it becomes stage III. Finally, in stage IV, cancer has spread throughout the entire body or to multiple organs.\n",
            "The stages are based upon the extent of disease and the presence of metastases. A stage is assigned to each cancer based in part on how far it has advanced and whether it’s spread. For example, if the primary tumor has not yet spread, you are assigned a stage zero. You are then assigned stage one if it spreads only to surrounding tissue. Then, as it advances, each stage becomes more serious. Once the spread of tumor cells has reached the lymphatic system, a patient is considered stage two. And if cancer spreads beyond that, patients are considered stages three and four. These stages help doctors determine the best treatment options.\n",
