        "1. **Lack of Semantic Meaning**: TF-IDF gives you the importance of the word, but it doesn't consider the context or the semantics of the word. It fails to capture the position in text, co-occurrences in documents, and semantics associated with the word.\n",
        "2. **Normalization Issue**: The main issue with TF-IDF is the normalization. The IDF is not always well scaled. A word that appears in every document will have an IDF score of 0, which eliminates all TF-IDF scores for that word.\n",
        "3. **Assumption of Independence**: TF-IDF assumes that the words are independent, i.e., the words are not related to each other. But we know that semantics and context are important in text data."

        "1. **Contextual Information**: Unlike traditional word embeddings, contextualized embeddings capture the context in which a word is used. This means that the same word can have different embeddings depending on its usage, allowing for a richer representation of text data.\n",
        "2. **Better Performance**: Contextualized embeddings often lead to better performance on a variety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and question answering, because they capture more nuanced semantic meanings.\n",
        "3. **Handling Polysemy**: They are capable of handling polysemy, where a single word can have multiple meanings based on context. For example, the word \"bank\" would have different embeddings in \"river bank\" and \"savings bank\".\n",

        "**Disadvantages** of Contextualized Embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Computational Complexity**: Generating contextualized embeddings is computationally intensive, as it involves running a deep learning model (like BERT or ELMo) which requires significant computational resources.\n",
        "2. **Model Size**: The models used to generate contextualized embeddings are often large, making them difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments.\n",
        "3. **Lack of Interpretability**: Like many deep learning models, the embeddings generated by these models are not easily interpretable."
